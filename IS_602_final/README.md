<h3> Final Project </h3>
This folder contains the files that make up my final project for IS 602: Advanced Programming Techniques. The ipynb can be run using IPython. The py file is the same code but can be run directly in the shell.

The final notebook can be seen rendered [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dbouquin/IS_602/blob/master/IS_602_final/IS602_final.ipynb).
