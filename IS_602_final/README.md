<h3> Final Project </h3>
This folder contains the files that make up my final project for IS 602: Advanced Programming Techniques. The ipynb can be run using IPython. The py file is the same code but can be run directly in the shell.

Use this code to enter three different astronomy or astrophysics related terms and compare recent authorship trends among papers containing those terms in their titles. You can then visualize the results as a violin plot.

The final notebook can be seen rendered [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dbouquin/IS_602/blob/master/IS_602_final/IS602_final.ipynb).
